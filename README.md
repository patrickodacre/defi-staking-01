# DeFi Practice - Token Staking

This project was inspired by Gregory @ [DApp University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgXQC4dbGUE&t=3316s).

If you haven't watched his material, I highly recommend it.

This application is a little different from the one Gregory builds in the tutorial, so if you're looking for the finished code for his application, you'll have to follow the links he posts beneath his video.

## Technical Features

You can learn a lot by just combing through a codebase to see examples of how a particular feature is implemented; in this repo you'll see the following: 

- token contracts created with OpenZeppelin's ERC20 proxy contract
- full suite of JavaScript tests to test our contract APIs
